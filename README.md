## Background

* Based on the SindoNews article [SindoNews](https://ekbis.sindonews.com/read/552156/33/menko-airlangga-hotel-dan-pariwisata-paling-terdampak-pandemi-covid-19-1632719382), quoted by the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto, he revealed that tourism and hospitality are the sectors that have been most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the tourism sector and the creative economy in Indonesia. You could say the last two years have been one of the biggest challenges for the tourism accommodation or hospitality industry players in Indonesia, to be able to continue to survive in the midst of the pandemic.

* According to BPS data [BPS, Monthly Hotel Survey (VHTS)](https://www.bps.go.id/indicator/16/122/1/tingkat-penghunian-kamar-pada-hotel-bintang.html), in January and February 2020 hotel occupants were still on a normal average, namely 49.71% and 49.22%. However, the pandemic caused the hotel room occupancy rate to drop dramatically in March to 32.24%, and continued to decline to 12.7% in April. The decline in the number of hotel occupants remained below 20% until entering the month of June 2020.
Starting on May 18, 2022, the Central Government has decided to relax the use of masks for outdoor activities and there are no restrictions on public activities. In addition, the government has also abolished the obligation to show COVID-19 test results for people traveling domestically and abroad who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 in full doses.
This indicates that the Indonesian people have started to travel on vacation. As we know that every trip requires a place to rest or stay to launch all the vacation plans that have been prepared.</li>

* According to the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy [Kemenparekraf/Baparekraf](https://kemenparekraf.go.id/direktori-statistik/tingkat-penghunian-kamar-hotel-bintang-tahun-2022), the Room Occupancy Rate (TPK) for star classification hotels in Indonesia in May 2022 reached an average of 49.85% or an increase of 17.88 points compared to April 2021 TPK which was 31.97%. The details of the data can be checked on the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy web page.After the pandemic atmosphere has returned to normal, many hotels have resumed operations to increase profits and help provide a retreat for tourists. However, some visitors can be said to be confused in determining the hotel of their choice according to their wishes and needs.Therefore, based on the problems above, group 1 tries to create an alternative web application called ClikSpace, which will provide hotel recommendations that can be chosen by tourists.

## Purpose of creating ClickSpace app

ClikSpace's goal is to make it easier for tourists or everyone who need a place to stay while on vacation by offering hotel suggestions for the best destinations and hotel pricing ranges.
